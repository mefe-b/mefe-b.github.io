### Local Bootstrap Installation

**1. Download Bootstrap Files** <br>
First, download the "Compiled CSS and JS" option from the [Download tab on Bootstrap's official website ](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/download/). This package contains CSS and JavaScript files.

**2. Include Files in Project** <br>
Open the .zip file you downloaded and move it from the css and js folders *"css/bootstrap.min.css"* *"js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"* to the app/assets directory of your Rails project. This step ensures that the project has access to Bootstrap files.

**3. Include CSS and JavaScript Files in the Application** <br>
First, add *.scss* extension to the "application.css" section.
Secondly, into the "application.css.scss" file we created *@import "bootstrap.min";*
add. Afterwards, add the *//= require bootstrap.bundle.min* section to the "application.js" file.

**4. Test in Browser**
You can make sure Bootstrap is installed successfully by refreshing the page. You can observe style changes by adding Bootstrap classes to HTML files (for example, `<button class="btn btn-primary">`).

After these steps, local Bootstrap will be ready for use.
