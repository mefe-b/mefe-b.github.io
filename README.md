# Welcome to My Software Journey

Hello, I'm Efe 👋. I'm diving deep into the world of software development 💻, with a focus on continuous learning 📚 and growth 🌱. On this blog, I’ll share:  
- My software projects  
- New technologies I’ve learned 🧠  
- Challenges I’ve faced ⚔️ and how I’ve overcome them 💪  

Writing about the problems and solutions in every project helps me improve 🔧 and assists others 🤝. Software is my passion 💖, not just a profession.

## Rails Learning Journey

I’m sharing the details of my Rails learning process. You can find the project repository [here](https://github.com/mefe-b/talent_nest). Under the mentorship of [Hamza Gedikkaya](https://github.com/hamzagedikkaya), I’m working on this project, and I document every issue and step in this blog. You can recreate the project or adapt it for your own use by following my detailed explanations.

Let’s learn together! 📖🚀
